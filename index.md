## Welcome
Hello, my name is Donte' Wilson and I've always dreamed of becoming a part of the gaming industry.I'm currently attending the Academy of Interactive Entertainment(AIE), I've currently developed skills in C++, C#, Python, and using Unity tools. I've always had a great interest in programs and how they are created. Throughout my life my main goal was to be able to develop and design games alongside a team of other developers just as passionate as I am.
